              <h2>My Background</h2>
              <p>
                Born and raised in Costa Rica where I lived untill I was 16.
                Halfway through my Junior year I moved to Slovakia with my
                family. After completing my highschool education I moved on to
                earn an undergraduate degree from Loyola University Chicago
                (LUC). My international background has given me a diverse
                cultural perspective and a strong ability for adaptability.
                These experiences have shaped who I am and enriched my life in
                countless ways.

              <h2>My Interests</h2>
              <p>
                They are many and diverse. Coming from Costa Rica I had no
                choice but to fall in love with football. I also carry a passion
                for history, reading, as well as getting outdoor for skiing or a
                walk. In my leftover free time I enjoy discovering new music and
                video games.

                I recently completed my B.S. in Software Engineering, having
                spent an amazing four years at Loyola University of Chicago
                (LUC). I now am looking to become part of a team as a SWEN and
                contribute in any way needed.

            While still quite young, I have been able to get a couple years of
            experience under my belt through various positions. This list is
            just getting started and I am always looking for new opportunities
